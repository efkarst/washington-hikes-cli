1. Plan your gem, imagine your interface
2. start with the project structure - google
3. start with the entry point - the file run\
4. force that to build the CLI interface

put in github?
5. stub out the interface w/ fake data
6. start making things real

WashingtonHikesCLI will be a command-line app to allow a user to find a hike in a specified region of Washington state, and potentially filter available hikes based on additional properties such as hike length and elevation gain.  When the user runs the app, they will see a greeting and be able to type a number corresponding to one of the following actions: choose the region they would like to look in, see all hikes, or exit the app.   Hikes will be scraped from wta.org based on filter criteria. 

If a user chooses to select a region, they will be asked to choose a region from a list scraped from wta.org or type 'back' to get to the main menu. If they select a region they will see a list of hikes available in that region including the name, length and elevation gain. The user can select a hike (by typing the corresponding number) to see additional details like the description.

From the main menu, if a user types "all" they will see a list of hikes across all regions and if they type "exit" they will exit the app.

The user will not be able to create or edit hikes.

This CLI project will have three classes: Hike, HikeScraper and WashingtonHikesCLI.
