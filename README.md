# WashingtonHikes

WashingtonHikesCLI will be a command-line app to allow a user to find a hike in a specified region of Washington state.  When the user runs the app, they will see a greeting and be able to choose the region they would like to look in, see all hikes or exit the app.   

If a user chooses to select a region, they will be asked to choose a region 'menu' to get to the main menu. If they select a region they will see a list of hikes available in that region including the name, length and elevation gain. The user can select a hike to see additional details like the description, features and rating.

After looking at a hike's details the user can choose to browse hikes by region, see hikes across Washington or exit the app.
